# June 4th, 2025: Finished the schematic and started the pcb!

First my first 3 hours(12am - 3pm AZ time) 

These hours were filled with me remembering how to use kicad. 

My big mistake when I went straight into making the schematic without planning out what I wanted. 
In the end I had to scratch it all and start again.

Last 3 hours(3pm - 6pm)
Before I went back to kicad I went into Keyboard Layout Editor to plan my out what
I wanted the keyboard to be. This includes the layout and what rows and columns for
each key. This made it easier to make the keyboard matrix in the schematic for kicad.
I finished the schematic around 4pm. A little later I joined a hackclub call.
During the call I started my pcb design. I only got about a third of the way done
with the design before I had to stop and leave the call because I left for FRC robotics.
