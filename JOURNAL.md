# Project IDEA

I want to make my very first full sized key keyboard by my self. The core reason for doing this project is to: learn more about pcb making and second is to understand the highway process works.

Total Time spent: 33h

# DAY 1: June 4th, 2025

## Finished the schematic and started the pcb!

**Time spent: 6h**

These hours were filled with me remembering how to use kicad. 
My big mistake when I went straight into making the schematic without planning out what I wanted. 
In the end I had to scratch it all and start again. Before I went back to kicad I went into Keyboard
Layout Editor to plan my out what I wanted the keyboard to be. This includes the layout and what rows
and columns for each key. This made it easier to make the keyboard matrix in the schematic for kicad.
I finished the schematic around 4pm. A little later I joined a hackclub call. During the call I started
my pcb design. I only got about a third of the way done with the design before I had to stop and leave
the call because I left for FRC robotics. **Shoutout Plasma Robotics!!**

# DAY 2: June 5th, 2025

## FINISHING MY PCB DESIGN ##

**Time spent: 9h**

I started with placing the keys dowm to make it look a keyboard. I was having problems placing the keys in the right spot.
I later learned that there are different grids i can use, which made it a lot easier. After I had the keys laid out I then
mooved on to placing the diodes. They ended up being harder than expected to place where they would nopt intrerfeare with
anything else in the pcb. Once I finally placing the diodes, I got to work wiring. This was the longest part by far. The
main reason behind it taking so long is because I was using surface-mount hardware. This means i could only connect to 
them on one side then causing there to be a lot of vias. At last I finished the wiring, it was just touch up in the end.
One thing that was a little annoying was I forgot to add stablizers. So i had to re-route a few things, but it wasn't to
bad. In the end it was a fun process that took a while but rewarding in the end.

# DAY 3: June 8th, 2025

## Started CAD for my case!!
**Time spent: 8h**

This day was all about cad. I spent basically the first hour - 2hours planning out what I wanted the keyboard to look like.
It was quite a fun process of first creating the basic sketch then slowly adding the that sketch. Sadly you can't see this
in the picture becuase I had drawn on one design instead of splitting it up. One big mistake i made was thinking it would
be simple to make this case, but by the end of the day I am only half way to the end of this case design. The steps I took
to make this case goes as follows. First, I imported my 3d pcb to use as a referance. Second, I desided on the mounting type
for the case. I was mainly deciding between a Top Mount Design or a Gasket Mount Design. In the end I chose a Gasket Mount
because I thought it could sound better even if it makes the design a little harder. Third, I went through the long and hard 
process of making the plate. What made it so hard was how I added extra padding on the sides of the pcb with a different size
on every side. So I couldn't use those automated plate makers. I ended up making my own plate, which took almost an hour by
itself. Lastly for the day was making a rough to part of the case. This didn't end up being to bad to make because of my
preemptive planning. Today was I fun test on what knowledge of Fusion 360. I learned a lot in this session about my 
patience.

# Day 4 Jun 11, 2025

## READY TO SUBMIT MY DESIGN!!

**Time Spent: 10h**

Today was probably my most productive day that I have had after starting this project. Today started out with me cading the bottom
part of the case. As I was finishing the cad for the case I relized the usb-c port was covered up, but if I were to cut a hole for
the usb it would look really bad. So I made the desision to make the usb-c port on a separate daughter board instead of directally
on the pcb. So I spent an hour designing another pcb. After I finished that I added it to my cad file. Once I did that I cut out a
hole for the port. Then I added some threads and mounting holes so the parts of the case so thaey can be put together. Lastly, I
spent an 4-5 hours improving my design and make it easier to manufacture. This means no fillets so which may make it a little bad
in the cad model, but when I put it together I can just sand down the corners.
