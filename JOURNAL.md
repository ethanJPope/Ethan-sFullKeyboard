# Project IDEA

I want to make my very first full sized key keyboard by my self. The main reason for doing this is to understand both pcb design and how the highway works.

# DAY 1: June 4th, 2025

## Finished the schematic and started the pcb!

**Time spent: 6h**

These hours were filled with me remembering how to use kicad. 
My big mistake when I went straight into making the schematic without planning out what I wanted. 
In the end I had to scratch it all and start again. Before I went back to kicad I went into Keyboard
Layout Editor to plan my out what I wanted the keyboard to be. This includes the layout and what rows
and columns for each key. This made it easier to make the keyboard matrix in the schematic for kicad.
I finished the schematic around 4pm. A little later I joined a hackclub call. During the call I started
my pcb design. I only got about a third of the way done with the design before I had to stop and leave
the call because I left for FRC robotics. **Shoutout Plasma Robotics!!**

# DAY 2: June 5th, 2025

## FINISHING MY PCB DESIGN ##

**Time spent: 9h**

I started with placing the keys dowm to make it look a keyboard. I was having problems placing the keys in the right spot.
I later learned that there are different grids i can use, which made it a lot easier. After I had the keys laid out I then
mooved on to placing the diodes. They ended up being harder than expected to place where they would nopt intrerfeare with
anything else in the pcb. Once I finally placing the diodes, I got to work wiring. This was the longest part by far. The
main reason behind it taking so long is because I was using surface-mount hardware. This means i could only connect to 
them on one side then causing there to be a lot of vias. At last I finished the wiring, it was just touch up in the end.
One thing that was a little annoying was I forgot to add stablizers. So i had to re-route a few things, but it wasn't to
bad. In the end it was a fun process that took a while but rewarding in the end.
